# ASP.NET Core with Angular 2 Base App

Base ASP.NET Core project with Angular 2 and TypeScript build-in. You can find more information on [my post](http://blog.nbellocam.me/2016/03/14/asp-net-core-and-angular-2/).

## Creating the base structure for this kind of project

In order to easily recreate this structure, you can follow the commits in this repository. Each commit shows a step to configure the base structure for this kind of project.

1. Create your _ASP.NET Core_ project with MVC: [79174d9](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/79174d9211706ff0f7f9ba1d789a3e3670b690ad)
2. Add _Angular 2_ dependencies to your _package.json_: [452a86e](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/452a86ef7b0f513f075877566485039eb322c907)
3. Add _Gulp_ tasks to copy the _Angular 2_ dependencies to the _wwwroot_ folder:  [1d2a6f1](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/1d2a6f1cfcf4212191d79a99fb2937d984c0e3e2)
4. Update layout to include _Angular 2_ dependencies: [d276963](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/d276963230e113399aa5b29d204278881f3abf9a). Minor path fix by [@mikekidder](http://github.com/mikekidder): [2b92f08](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/2b92f08661710507f3c6922ce4b3badf8a4125a2)
5. Add _TypeScript_ configuration file: [bbd1842](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/bbd1842e47905e4236b83415901479272b94ddc3)
6. Add _es6-shim_'s TypeScript definitions: [fdbd2f3](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/fdbd2f3e8f969f55fe9ef176f1d44028d31941aa)
7. Add _app.component.ts_ file with the sample AppComponent: [0e9567f](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/0e9567fb93143ae38f4d742aeff9b5c1491ad884)
8. Add _boot.ts_ with the bootstrap of the _Angular 2_ application: [051a0a2](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/051a0a27b6c8aacbd01130d394d235c6d782aa31)
9. Update index page with the logic to initialize the _Angular 2_ application: [514ce93](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/commit/514ce9333341f121477e7e24792780b66e355f8f)


## Adding routing suport to your Angular application

To keep this sample simple and include the feedback and code from [@BradRem](http://github.com/BradRem), I added a new branch named [routing-sample](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/tree/routing-sample) with the base structure for Angular 2 routing.

## Adding http suport to your Angular application

I added a new branch named [http-sample](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/tree/http-sample) with the base structure for using the HTTP service in Angular 2 to consume an ASP.NET Core API.

## Full sample (with routing and http)

You can find the full solution with Angular 2 configured to use HTTP and Route components in an ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio in the [full-sample](https://github.com/nbellocam/Angular2ASPNETCoreBaseApp/tree/full-sample) branch.
